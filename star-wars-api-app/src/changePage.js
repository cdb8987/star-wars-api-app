//What we want here is to add a lateral/span type HTML element that will contain 9 buttons corresponding to different api requests (Page 1 will start at value 1, Page 2 will start at Value 11, etc).  We also want 2 buttons that will change the select a page based on the selected page.  We will need to hold a "reference value" to do this.
